Medh\u0101tithi\u2019s commentary (manubh\u0101\u1e63ya): # \u2018With a view to the development of the regions.\u2019 terrestrial and the rest;\u2014\u2018development\u2019 stands for Nourishment and expansion; it is only when the four castes, Br\u0101hma\u1e47a and the rest, are there that there is development of the three regions; for the Gods live upon offerings made by these castes,\u2014these castes alone being entitled to the performance of sacrifices; so that the action done by these nourishes the two regions (celestial and subterranean); then again, the Gods also are prompted by men\u2019s action to act; from the Sun-God comes rain; and thus the said creation (of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a) tends to the nourishment of this (terrestrial) region also. \u2018He brought unto existence,\u2019\u2014i.e., produced, the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a and other castes,\u2014\u2018from out of his mouth, arm\u2019, thighs and feet\u2019 respectively; i.e., the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a from out of his mouth, the K\u1e63atriya out of his arms, the Vai\u015bya out of his thighs and the \u015a\u016bdra out of his feet.\u2014The affix \u2018tasi\u2019 (in \u2018mukha b\u0101h\u0101rup\u0101data\u1e25\u2019) has the sense of the Ablative; the effect is, as it were, drawn out of the cause; and this implying a sort of separation, the use of the Ablative becomes fully justified. It was only a certain primeval Br\u0101hma\u1e47a whom Praj\u0101pati produced, by his divine power, out of the component particles of his own mouth; because so far as the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as of the present day are concerned, they are all actually found to be produced by intercourse between human couples, out of the material principles. In reality however, what is stated here is merely commendatory, intended to show the relative superiority and inferiority of the castes;\u2014the meaning being\u2014\u2018of all beings Praj\u0101pati is the highest,\u2014among all the limbs of Praj\u0101pati, the mouth is the highest,\u2014similarly the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a is the highest, most praiseworthy, of all the castes;\u2019 and on the basis of this similarity the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a is described as produced out of Brahma\u2019s mouth. Or, the description of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a coming out of Brahma\u2019s mouth may be due to the fact that the work of the mouth, such as teaching and the like, belongs preeminently to the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a; to the K\u1e63atriya belongs the work of the arms, lighting; to the Vai\u015bya the work of the thighs, such as wandering about with the cows, when tending cattle, and also travelling for trade on land and water; and to the \u015a\u016bdra belongs the work of the feet, i.e., service. Conclusion # The above commentary is a desperate attempt to justify the caste superiority as described in this verse. The fact that Brahmana is born from mouth and sudra from feet is itself an indication that the book was written to promote inequality among different sections of the society.","title":"Creation of Brahmana and other Castes"},{"location":"religious-texts/manusmriti/creation-of-brahmana-and-other-castes/#creation-of-brahmana-and-other-castes","text":"","title":"Creation of Brahmana and Other Castes"},{"location":"religious-texts/manusmriti/creation-of-brahmana-and-other-castes/#verse-131","text":"\u0932\u094b\u0915\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0902 \u0924\u0941 \u0935\u093f\u0935\u0943\u0926\u094d\u0927\u094d\u092f\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902 \u092e\u0941\u0916\u092c\u093e\u0939\u0942\u0930\u0941\u092a\u093e\u0926\u0924\u0903 \u0964 \u092c\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0939\u094d\u092e\u0923\u0902 \u0915\u094d\u0937\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u0902 \u0935\u0948\u0936\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u0936\u0942\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0902 \u091a \u0928\u093f\u0930\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u092f\u0924\u094d \u0965 \u0969\u0967 \u0965 With a view to the development of the (three) regions, He brought into existence the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, the K\u1e63atriya, the Vai\u015bya and the \u015a\u016bdra, from out of his mouth, arms, thighs and feet (respectively).","title":"Verse 1.31"},{"location":"religious-texts/manusmriti/creation-of-brahmana-and-other-castes/#conclusion","text":"The above commentary is a desperate attempt to justify the caste superiority as described in this verse.
