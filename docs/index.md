It is a common disbelief among the believers that atheists don't have morality and ethics. However, it's in the nature of humans to possess basic humanitarian qualities like empathy and kindness towards fellow human beings (Thanks to evolution!!).
We have constitution, laws and orders and security in a country to prevent crimes and these laws are not based on religion. So it can safely be concluded that religion is not required for morality and ethics.

In fact, it is commonly observed that religious people tend to have hatred towards other people who don't belong to their community. Hence it is the religion which urgently needs to understand basic human values.
