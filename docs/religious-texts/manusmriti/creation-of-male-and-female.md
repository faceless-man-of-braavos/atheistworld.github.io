# Creation of the Male and the Female

## Verse 1.32

द्विधा कृत्वाऽत्मनो देहमर्धेन पुरुषोऽभवत् । <br>
अर्धेन नारी तस्यां स विराजमसृजत् प्रभुः ॥ ३२ ॥

    Having divided his body into two halves, with the one half, the Lord became Male, and with the other half, 
    Female; from her he produced Virāj.

#### Medhātithi’s commentary (manubhāṣya):
The creation described here is apparently of another Being; but others have held that it is of the same Brahmā; 
the meaning being that the body that came out of the Egg being divided into two halves, ‘with one half 
he became Male’—i.e., he became a male being, capable of instilling semen—and ‘with the other half he became 
the Female’; that is, his body assumed the form of the Hermaphrodite, like Gaurī-Śaṅkara (combined in a single body). 
Or, it may mean that he crested the Female apart (from the Male).—Having created her, he produced, from her, by the act
of procreation, that being whose well-known name is ‘Virāj.’ What is meant is that Prajāpati had recourse to his own daughter.

This mention of the bifurcation of Prajāpati’s body is based upon the fact that the husband and wife differ only in 
their bodies, and in all functions they are entirely united.

## Conclusion

As usual the so-called intellectual rishis who wrote manusmriti had no idea about `evolution` and how humans have evolved over the course of their history.

Darwin's theory of evolution is a major threat to all the popular religions of the world because it rejects the idea of supernatural claim of appearance of first humans on earth.
