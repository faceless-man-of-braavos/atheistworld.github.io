# Creation of Heaven and Earth

## Verse 1.12

तस्मिन्नण्डे स भगवानुषित्वा परिवत्सरम् । <br>
स्वयमेवात्मनो ध्यानात् तदण्डमकरोद् द्विधा ॥ १२ ॥

    That supreme lord, having dwelt in that egg for a year, himself, by his own thought, broke that egg into two parts.


#### Medhātithi’s commentary (manubhāṣya):

‘That Supreme Lord,’ Brahmā,—‘for a year,’ during a year,—‘having dwelt in that egg,’—the omniscient one, who had come 
into existence and was seated in the egg, thought of the way in which he would come out of it;—‘he broke the egg into 
two parts’;—one year is the time which the embryo takes for its development; so that after a year the egg, having 
reached its full development, burst (really), by reason of its full development having been reached. It is thus a 
chance coincidence that the egg burst just at the time that Brahmā was thinking of coming out; and it is in view of 
this coincidence that he is described as having broken the egg into two parts.

## Verse 1.13

ताभ्यां स शकलाभ्यां च दिवं भूमिं च निर्ममे ।  <br>
मध्ये व्योम दिशश्चाष्टावपां स्थानं च शाश्वतम् ॥ १३ ॥

    Out of those two pieces (of the egg) he formed Heaven and Earth, and, between them, the Ākāśa, 
    the eight quarters and the eternal receptacle of water.

#### Medhātithi’s commentary (manubhāṣya):

‘Two pieces’—the two halves of the egg-shell; out of these two pieces of the egg-shell,—‘he formed,’ produced,—‘and 
Earth’; the lower half being earth [and the upper half Heaven];—‘between them Ākāśa,’ empty space,—‘the eight quarters,’
the East and the rest, along with the intermediate points of the South-East, etc.;—‘the receptacle of water’—(1) in the 
atmosphere, (2) the Ocean and (3) the Ākāśa within the Earth and the Nether Regions.


## Conclusion

The above two verses clearly state that the earth and heaven were created after a magical egg was broken into two pieces.
This is an indication of the fact that the ancient rishis who wrote the laws of manusmriti had no idea about the creation of
universe and solar system. They were unaware of "Big Bang Theory", which is now regarded as the most widely acceptable theory to explain
the creation of universe and solar system.
