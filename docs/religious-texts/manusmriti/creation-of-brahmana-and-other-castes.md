    With a view to the development of the (three) regions, He brought into existence the Brāhmaṇa, 
    the Kṣatriya, the Vaiśya and the Śūdra, from out of his mouth, arms, thighs and feet (respectively).

#### Medhātithi’s commentary (manubhāṣya):

‘With a view to the development of the regions.’ terrestrial and the rest;—‘development’ stands for Nourishment and 
expansion; it is only when the four castes, Brāhmaṇa and the rest, are there that there is development of the three 
regions; for the Gods live upon offerings made by these castes,—these castes alone being entitled to the performance 
of sacrifices; so that the action done by these nourishes the two regions (celestial and subterranean); then again, 
the Gods also are prompted by men’s action to act; from the Sun-God comes rain; and thus the said creation 
(of the Brāhmaṇa) tends to the nourishment of this (terrestrial) region also.

‘He brought unto existence,’—i.e., produced, the Brāhmaṇa and other castes,—‘from out of his mouth, arm’, thighs 
and feet’ respectively; i.e., the Brāhmaṇa from out of his mouth, the Kṣatriya out of his arms, the Vaiśya out of his 
thighs and the Śūdra out of his feet.—The affix ‘tasi’ (in ‘mukha bāhārupādataḥ’) has the sense of the Ablative; the 
effect is, as it were, drawn out of the cause; and this implying a sort of separation, the use of the Ablative 
becomes fully justified.

It was only a certain primeval Brāhmaṇa whom Prajāpati produced, by his divine power, out of the component particles 
of his own mouth; because so far as the Brāhmaṇas of the present day are concerned, they are all actually found to be 
produced by intercourse between human couples, out of the material principles.

In reality however, what is stated here is merely commendatory, intended to show the relative superiority and 
inferiority of the castes;—the meaning being—‘of all beings Prajāpati is the highest,—among all the limbs of Prajāpati,
the mouth is the highest,—similarly the Brāhmaṇa is the highest, most praiseworthy, of all the castes;’ and on the basis 
of this similarity the Brāhmaṇa is described as produced out of Brahma’s mouth.

Or, the description of the Brāhmaṇa coming out of Brahma’s mouth may be due to the fact that the work of the mouth, 
such as teaching and the like, belongs preeminently to the Brāhmaṇa; to the Kṣatriya belongs the work of the arms, 
lighting; to the Vaiśya the work of the thighs, such as wandering about with the cows, when tending cattle, 
and also travelling for trade on land and water; and to the Śūdra belongs the work of the feet, i.e., service.

## Conclusion

The above commentary is a desperate attempt to justify the caste superiority as described in this verse. The fact that
Brahmana is born from mouth and sudra from feet is itself an indication that the book was written to promote inequality among
different sections of the society.
